# Dice-Challenge-Game

A dice challenge game for 2 players to compete the largest dice value rolled from each player.

# Features

A 3 second timmer that countdowns before each round

A score tracker that keeps track of the player who rolls the highest dice each round.

# Inspiration 

The inspiration of the project came about when i was going through a similar tutorial that builds a dice game 
that needs to be manually refresh to restart the game and there was no score tracker used to keep track of the game.
Hence , this  project was build to add more features to enhance the game.
